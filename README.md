# app
The slidewinder web/desktop app

## Run the app
To get the meteor app running fire up your ```terminal``` and: 

```
cd slidewinder
meteor
```
Meteor will install all the packages and dependencies. This could take a minute or so. Once everything has installed, you can go see the magic at: ```http://localhost:3000```
